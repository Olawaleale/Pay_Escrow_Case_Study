# Pay_Escrow_Case_Study
I developed a 12-month product roadmap for Pay Escrow, which enables an independent third party to temporarily hold funds until certain transaction or value obligations are met by the buyer or seller. This solution will be implemented across various countries in Africa, where the sellers are referred to as merchants, and the buyers are customers.
The following were identified
•	12-month product roadmap 
•	Metrics to track
•	Revenue model 
•	Go-to-market strategy 
•	Teams required
