# Pay_Escrow_Case_Study

**SOLUTION**

I developed a 12-month product roadmap for Pay Escrow, which enables an independent third party to temporarily hold funds until certain transaction or value obligations are met by the buyer or seller. 
This solution will be implemented across various countries in Africa, where the sellers are referred to as merchants, and the buyers are customers.

The following were identified:

a) Build a 12-month product roadmap

b) Choose the metrics you would track and why  

c) Revenue model for this product 

d) Go-to-market strategy 

e) Teams required and specific responsibilities highlighted



**QUESTION**

As a newly appointed Product Manager at X organization, my task is to develop a solution called Pay Escrow, which enables an independent third party to temporarily hold funds until certain transaction or value obligations are met by the buyer or seller. This solution will be implemented across various countries in Africa, where the sellers are referred to as merchants, and the buyers are customers.

In traditional e-commerce scenarios, merchants typically receive their settlements on the next business day (T+1). However, with Pay Escrow, merchants will only receive their settlements the day after the customer confirms receipt of the ordered item(s) by providing a specific code indicating they have received the expected value.

In cases where the customer does not receive the expected value within the agreed-upon delivery period, the customer will automatically receive a refund back to their account.

Now, considering a 12-month timeframe, how would you suggest approaching the development of a product roadmap for building this service?

Expectations 

a) Build a 12-month product roadmap 

b) Choose the metrics you would track and why 

c) Come up with a revenue model for this product 

d) Come up with a go-to-market strategy 

e) What teams would you require to support the product and what specific responsibilities would you require from them? 
Your presentation slides should not be more than 10 slides.
